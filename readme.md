### Experiment for Belief Updating and Misinformation

This repository contains the code for the two experiments 
which are part of the project 'Belief Updating with Misinformation'.
The experiment is coded using oTree.

Overview for the different files:
* 'belief_survey' contains the main treatment with ex-post information checks.
* 'belief_survey_aggregate' is a second treatment with combined signals.
* 'Intro' serves as the introduction for any experiment with Prolific subjects.
* 'questionnaire' contains standard demographic questions.
