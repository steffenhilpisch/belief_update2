            This is a follow-up study. The participants of the first study were shown the following instructions which are important for you as well:
            <br>
            <br>
            There are two urns, one red and one blue, each containing 4 balls as displayed below.
            All balls are labeled with a letter 'I', the meaning of which will be explained on the next page.
            One of the two urns will be randomly selected in the beginning.
            You do not know which urn will be selected. It will remain the same throughout this study.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="{{ static 'img/red_or_blue_urn_label.png' }}" style="width:40%;"/>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            Your <b>task will be to guess which urn you think was selected</b>.
            To do so you will receive hints about the selected urn in form of reports from participants of the first study.
            You will get further information on the next page.
        </p>
        <p>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-tab next" data-offset="1">Next</button>

        <p>
            The selected urn contained 4 balls, 3 of the same color and 1 of the opposite color, as shown on the previous page.
            All balls from the selected urn were put into a black box. They were labeled with the letter 'I', which stands for 'informative'.
            <br>
            For the moment you do not know the color of the selected urn and therefore the 4 informative balls are displayed in grey (although they have a color, either red or blue).
            <br><br>
            The black box also contained 6 other balls that do not come from the urn. These 6 balls were labeled with the letter 'U', which stands for 'uninformative'.
            Knowing the color of the uninformative balls did not help to identify the selected urn.
            <b>The black box and the 10 balls inside it remained the same throughout the entire study.</b>
        </p>

            This study has {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds in total.
            In each round you get one of two possible hints:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>A report</b> is shown. You are told the reported probability by participants of the first study.
                    You do not know if the balls they have seen were informative or uninformative.
                <li>
                    No new report is shown, but you receive <b>information about the ball the other participant previously saw</b>.
                    You will be told if the ball the other person saw before was one of the 4 informative balls or
                    one of the 6 uninformative balls.
                    <i>Example:</i> Previously, the other participant saw a red ball.
                    The ball that was drawn last round was one of the 6 uninformative balls. &nbsp;
                    <img src="{{ static 'img/red_ball_u.png' }}" width="40" height="auto"/>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In every round you will be asked to make a guess about the urn that has been selected in the beginning.
            At the end of the study you will be told the color of this urn.
            You will receive a bonus which depends on the accuracy of your answer to one of the 3 guesses (you do not know which one). The procedure for calculating your bonus is
            described in detail below. You may skip these details. The important thing is that <b>the procedure guarantees that you should
            expect to maximize your bonus by reporting what you truly think the chances are in each question.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <input type="hidden" name="sr_button_clicks" id="sr_button_clicks" value="0"/>

            <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Details about the bonus calculation</button>

            <div style="display:none" id="scoring_rule">

            <strong>We apply the following procedure:</strong>
            <br><br>
            First, we randomly pick one of the questions. For this question, we calculate the error you made.
            This is how many percentage points your report was away from 100% (if the RED URN was selected)
            or from 0% (if the BLUE URN was selected). Then, we plug in the error into the following formula:
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">{{ Constants.scoring_rule_factor }} - {{ Constants.scoring_rule_factor }} ∙ error²</div>
            <br>
            This will be your bonus (in Euros).
            <br><br>
            <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> Suppose that you report 60% chance that the RED URN was selected in Step 1.
            Then, your bonus is calculated as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>If the urn was RED:
                <ul>
                    <li>your error is (100%-60%) = 40%</li>
                    <li>your bonus is {{ Constants.scoring_rule_factor }}-{{ Constants.scoring_rule_factor }}∙(40%)² = {{example_60_red}} Euros</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the urn was BLUE:
                <ul>
                    <li>your error is (60%-0%) = 60%</li>
                    <li>your bonus is {{ Constants.scoring_rule_factor }}-{{ Constants.scoring_rule_factor }}∙(60%)² = {{example_60_blue}} Euros</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            As we have already mentioned, you should expect to maximize your earnings by reporting what you
            actually think are the chances of a RED URN.
            <br><br>
            <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> If you actually think that the chances are 60% that the RED URN was selected, then:
            <ul>
                <li>By reporting 60%, you will make on average <strong>{{example_60_60}} Euros</strong>.</li>
                <li>By reporting 10%, you will make on average <strong>{{example_60_10}} Euros</strong>.</li>
                <li>By reporting 100%, you will make on average <strong>{{example_60_100}} Euros</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            As you see <strong>you maximize your earning by reporting exactly 60%</strong>.
            The further away you report from what you actually think, the less money you should expect to make.
