            There are two urns, one red and one blue, as displayed below. One of the two urns was chosen in the beginning.
            It will remain the same throughout this study. You do not know which of the 2 urns was selected.

                The 4 informative balls, labeled with an 'I', from the selected urn were added to the black box displayed below.
                You do not know the color of the urn that was selected.
                The 4 added balls are therefore displayed in grey.
                But these are either 3 red balls and 1 blue ball or 3 blue balls and 1 red ball.
                The black box also contains 6 other uninformative balls, labeled with a 'U', that do not come from the urn.
                A ball is drawn from the black box. The color of the ball is shown to you and
                the ball is put back into the box with the other balls.
